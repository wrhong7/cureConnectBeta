The smart recruiter that stands by you until you find what you like.

We care about you

We reach out to hospitals and show them your resume until you find the career that you believe in. cureConnect is always free for nurses.




Step 1: Take 5 mins to let us know who you are

It really only takes five minutes

Tell us what you believe in, what are your preference in terms of pay & benefits, hours, patient type & load, location & commuting distance. 

Shop your career as you order online

You spend hours filling out the same information that is listed on the resume. You fill out the information once and use the same information for application. Your next career change may be one button away.


Step 2: Crystal clear information & Application status tracking

We believe in right to information

How many times have you called with recruiters that offer jobs that pay only half of what you get paid? We respect your time and believe in your right to know. With us you will know the benefits & compensation range, healthcare and pensions, approximate hours, patient type and loads, and mission of the hospital.

We believe you deserve to know everything in real-time

You spent 2 hours filling out the forms and never heard back from recruiters. That never happens with cureConnect. We tell you real-time status of your application and help you schedule the interviews through our network.


Step 3: Invest on things that matter

Spend smart

cureConnect only charges flat fee to hospitals contingent on them finding a fitting candidate. There is no risk of running an advertising campaign on job boards only to get unqualified candidates. 

Qualified candidates

We use computer algorithms and human confirmations to ensure candidate quality. With cureConnect, you will be able to screen potential candidates faster and more efficient way. Invest time and energy on qualified candidates.
