Modification of Terms of Use
CureConnect reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Use at any time and will update these Terms of Use in the event of any such amendments.

Governing Law
These Terms of Use and any access to or use of the Website or the Service shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions, which might otherwise cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California. You and CureConnect agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City of San Diego, California, except as provided below in this Agreement.
Arbitration
If a dispute arises from or relates to these Terms of Use or the breach thereof, and if the dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, the parties agree to endeavor first to settle the dispute by mediation administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Mediation Procedures before resorting to arbitration. The parties further agree that any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract, or breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Limitation of Term of Action
All disputes or claims (to the extent permitted by law) must be filed within one year from when the claim or notice of dispute could be filed in an arbitration proceeding or court if arbitration is not permitted. If you do not file a claim or dispute during this time, it is permanently barred.
Severability
If any portion or provision of this Agreement shall to any extent be declared illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such portion of provision in circumstances other than those as to which it is so declared illegal or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each portion and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Assignment and Delegation
CureConnect may assign or delegate these Terms of Use and/or the CureConnect Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent.
